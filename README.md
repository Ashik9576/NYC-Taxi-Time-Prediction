# NYC Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction
The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this project. Based on individual trip attributes, you should predict the duration of each trip in the test set. NYC Taxi Data.csv - the training set (contains 1458644 trip records)

The New York City Taxi Fare prediction challenge is a supervised regression machine learning task. Given pickup and drop-off locations, the pickup timestamp, and the passenger count, the objective is to predict the fare of the taxi ride. this problem isnâ€™t 100% reflective of those in industry, but it does present a realistic dataset and task on which we can hone our machine learning skills.
Some of the important attributes of the dataset are discussed below:
* Id: which provides a unique identification to a trip.
* vendor id: a unique code which gets assigned to the different cab companies.
* pickup datetime: starting statistics of the pickup.
* dropoff datetime: ending statistics of the pickup.
* passenger count: passengers travelling in a particular trip.
* pickup longitude: longitudinal location of the pickup.
* pickup latitude: latitudinal location of the pickup.
* dropoff longitude: longitudinal location of the drop off.
* dropoff latitude: latitudinal location of the drop off.
* store and fwd flag:  a code to identify whether the data is stored on the device and then gets forwarded to the database.
* trip duration: the total time of the trip in seconds.
